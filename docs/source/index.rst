Welcome to KSP2 Modder Knowledge
===================================

The goal of this project is to conceive an Open-source Mod Wiki for Kerbal Space Program 2, where modders can post articles, guides, 
tutorials or findings to share their knowledge with the community. Feel free to contribute to help other developers.

.. note::
   Mod development is still in an experimental phase. Keep in mind that, in the absence of official support, there may
   be many changes that will affect your projects.

Getting Started
---------------

Right now BepInEx is being used to inject plugins into the game, along with SpaceWarp, a tool that serves as a layer
of abstraction to configure and maintain mod dependencies and provide facilities that support their development, such as
an API.
